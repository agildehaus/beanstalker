## Installation

* Clone the project to the root of a webserver that is setup for hosting PHP.
* Your webserver must rewrite requests to index.php.  See [.htaccess](.htaccess) for details.
* Edit config.php to set your beanstalkd server address.
* This software currently has no authentication (it's planned).  Be sure to deny traffic to it from untrusted sources.
